## Design

Built-in calendar?
Come, this is just a notice-recieving app. Should be just it.
Shall be very glad to see anyone implements one, as this is indeed in need.

TODO-list?
Maybe you can self-send notice?

## APPs

### mobile

- termux: TODO should be able to use with a software, so one can view items in his favorite nvim
